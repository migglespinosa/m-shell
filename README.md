# m-shell

Learning C++ is a short-term goal of mine.

To become more antiquated with the language, I will build a very basic shell called m-shell, which will do just three things: initialize, execute commands, and terminate.

The commands allowed will be:
- help
- quit
- mkfile
- delfile
- mkfolder
- delfolder

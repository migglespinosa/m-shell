# m-shell

Learning C++ is a short-term goal of mine.

To become more antiquated with the language, I will build a very basic shell called m-shell, which will do just three things: initialize, execute commands, and terminate. 

The commands allowed will be:
- Floating point addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
- Display time
- Terminate
